# Schematic Capture
KiCad's Schematic Editor supports everything from the most basic schematic to a complex hierarchical design with hundreds of sheets. Create your own custom symbols or use some of the thousands found in the official KiCad library. Verify your design with integrated SPICE simulator and electrical rules checker.
